This repository contains the complete codebase and documentation for my undergraduate thesis at Gono University. The project focuses on developing a robust, explainable AI model to predict the risk of Radiation Pneumonitis (RP) in lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.

The core novelty of this research lies in its rigorous two-stage generalizability analysis:
1.  **Development:** An initial model is trained on a large, public dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
2.  **External Validation:** The model is then tested on a unique, real-world cohort of patients from hospitals in Bangladesh to assess its performance and robustness in a new clinical environment.

This work is driven by a commitment to leveraging AI to solve tangible clinical problems and improve patient outcomes in oncology.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a non-invasive tool that uses standard pre-treatment data (CT scans and radiotherapy plans) to generate a personalized risk score for developing clinically significant (Grade ‚â• 2) Radiation Pneumonitis. By identifying high-risk patients *before* treatment begins, this tool could enable clinicians to create safer, more individualized treatment plans.

## üî¨ Methodology & Workflow

The project follows a powerful pipeline for medical AI research, integrating multiple data modalities for a comprehensive analysis.

**`Pre-Treatment CT (Radiomics)` + `RT Dose Plan (Dosiomics)` + `Clinical Data` ‚ûî `Feature Extraction` ‚ûî `AI Model Training` ‚ûî `Pneumonitis Risk Score (XAI)`**

1.  **Data Curation:** Two cohorts are used: a public development cohort (`NSCLC-Radiomics` from TCIA) and a local validation cohort (from Ahsania Cancer Hospital, Bangladesh).
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * **Radiomics:** High-dimensional features quantifying the texture and morphology of lung tissue are extracted from CT scans using `PyRadiomics`.
    * **Dosiomics:** Features quantifying the 3D radiation dose distribution are extracted from DICOM-RT DOSE files.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Both classical machine learning (e.g., Random Forest) and deep learning (MLP in PyTorch) models will be developed and compared.
4.  **Explainable AI (XAI):** The final model's predictions will be interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the specific imaging and dosimetric biomarkers that are most predictive of pneumonitis risk.

## üí° Key Novelty Points

* **Generalizability Analysis:** Directly addresses a major challenge in medical AI by testing a model on a new, geographically and ethnically distinct population.
* **Multi-Modal Integration:** Combines radiomics, dosiomics, and clinical data for a holistic patient assessment.
* **Explainability:** Moves beyond a "black box" prediction to provide transparent, interpretable results that can offer new clinical insights.
